SQL relationships
In SQL, we create relationships to connect data stored in different tables so it can work together in a logical and consistent way.

Why we create relationships:

1. Avoid Data Duplication (Normalization)
Instead of storing the same information multiple times, we put it in one place and link to it.

2. Maintain Data Consistency (Integrity)
If a customer changes their phone number, we update it in one table, and all related data stays correct.

3. Make Queries Easier and More Powerful
Relationships allow us to JOIN tables to get combined information.

4. Reflect Real-World Structure
In the real world, things are related — customers place orders, orders contain products, products belong to categories.

5. Improve Performance
When data is well-structured in related tables, queries can run faster and indexes work better than in one huge, repetitive table.

------------------------------------------------------

Main commands used to work with data in a table :
    - INSERT
    - UPDATE 
    - DELETE 
    - SELECT

-------------------
1- INSERT : Used to add new rows(records) to a table.

>>> INSERT INTO TABLE(field01, field02, .....) VALUES (value of field01, value of field02, .....)

EX: 
>>> INSERT INTO `categories`(`CategoryID`, `CategoryName`, `Description`) VALUES (NULL, 'clothes','men, women, children clothes')

>>> INSERT INTO `categories`(`CategoryName`, `Description`) VALUES ('clothes','men, women, children clothes')



---------------------
2- UPDATE : Used to modify existing rows(records).

>>> UPDATE TABLE SET field01=value01, field02=value02, ..... WHERE condition(s)

EX:
>>> UPDATE `categories` SET `CategoryName`='أحذية ومنتجات جلدية',`Description`='أحذية أطفال وكبار وشنط' WHERE `CategoryID`=10


---------------------
3- DELETE : Used to delete rows(records) from a table.

>>> DELETE FROM TABLE WHERE condition(s)

EX:
>>> DELETE FROM `categories` WHERE `CategoryID`=9

--------------------
4- SELECT : Used to retrieve data from a table(S).

    - comparison operators : >  <  >=  <=   =   <>

    - ORDER BY

    - logic operations : AND, OR, NOT, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL

    - aggregate functions : MIN, MAX. COUNT, AVG, SUM
    
    - relationships with SELECT

    - GROUP BY, HAVING

EX:

>>> SELECT * FROM `products` ORDER BY `products`.`UnitPrice`

>>> SELECT `ProductID`,`ProductName`,`UnitPrice` FROM `products` WHERE 1 ORDER BY `ProductName` DESC;

>>> SELECT `EmployeeID`,`FirstName` FROM `employees` WHERE `FirstName` LIKE '%an%';

>>> SELECT `EmployeeID`,`FirstName` FROM `employees` WHERE `FirstName` LIKE 'an%';
